<h2>Speech to text</h2>
* this is a simple talk to text feature with python
and not saving anything towards the database
this thing may lag but it's functional
*if you want to use this for future purposes make sure to download the following
    * speech recognition for python
    * pyaudio
    * and make sure to update the software as some of the features when downloading is out of date and it will ask you in the terminal if you want to update the installation!

1. this project's purpose is for those who want to have jobs that work from home and instead of typing out literature from books into e books, you can speak and the software will pick up on the speech and put it visually in the text editor, and you can fix those words as you go.

thank you and have a great day!
